    "So far so good. But is that really it? It seems that we are done but before we congratulate ourselves we might want to take a look at the documentation (see: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html) to see how the default sort() actually works. From the documentation it's not entirely clear what the default behaviour of sort() is when we have a list of lists. How is it really sorting our tuples? Is it only sorting on the first element of the nested tuple and then finishing or is it going through the first element, then the second element and so on? With our particular list of tuples in the format that they are, it is difficult to tell. Additionally, we know from the documentation that when there is a list of lists - they don't show any tuples here - they are stipulating on which key to sort - the first or second element and so on. So this should lead us to question what is really happening here. Let's dig a little further with our own example and make sure we are on the right track. "

We are also going to continue along using our familiar example of IP addresses that we used in the previous sections. Storing IP addresses as a NumPy array makes sense in a way - the construct of many IP addresses together is essentially a construct of an nd-array - a multi-dimensional array of homogenous data. For those who are interested see Tom Augspurger's post (https://tomaugspurger.github.io/pandas-extension-arrays.html) for a practical scenario of using NumPy with IP addresses. Don't worry if the reading sounds a little advanced just note at this stage that NumPy is used to store IP addresses but that in order to cater for the complexity of a real-world situation a degree of coding 'trickery' had to be introduced."

Can't we just use structured arrays in NumPy for tabular data rather than the Pandas DataFrame for example? Well, as we have proved in the above section we see certainly can do so. However, as the documentation (see https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html) points out there are many reasons why we wouldn't - the least of the reasons being a syntax which is rather unwieldy. This leads us quite naturally to our next section on Pandas. "
