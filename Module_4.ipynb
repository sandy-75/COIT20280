It seems that we are done but before we congratulate ourselves we might want to take a look at the documentation (see: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html) to see how the default sort() actually works. From the documentation it's not entirely clear what the default behaviour of sort() is when we have a list of lists. How is it really sorting our tuples? Is it only sorting on the first element of the nested tuple and then finishing or is it going through the first element, then the second element and so on? With our particular list of tuples in the format that they are, it is difficult to tell. Additionally, we know from the documentation that when there is a list of lists - they don't show any tuples here - they are stipulating on which key to sort - the first or second element and so on. So this should lead us to question what is really happening here. Let's dig a little further with our own example and make sure we are on the right track. "

We are also going to continue along using our familiar example of IP addresses that we used in the previous sections. Storing IP addresses as a NumPy array makes sense in a way - the construct of many IP addresses together is essentially a construct of an nd-array - a multi-dimensional array of homogenous data. For those who are interested see Tom Augspurger's post (https://tomaugspurger.github.io/pandas-extension-arrays.html) for a practical scenario of using NumPy with IP addresses. Don't worry if the reading sounds a little advanced just note at this stage that NumPy is used to store IP addresses but that in order to cater for the complexity of a real-world situation a degree of coding 'trickery' had to be introduced."

    "Note in the above that our IP addresses themselves are not preserved. The effect of sorting on the columns is to take all the values in each of the columns and sort them into ascending order. However, what if we wanted to preserve the IP addresses similar as tuples but still use the NumPy array format? How can we do so? One way to do so is by using the order keyword. However, the order keyword will only work if our numpy array has been defined with fields (see the documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sort.html#numpy.sort). Note: there are many ways you can create a structured array. However, for this particular exercise try following the second example in the official docs if you aren't too sure. Firstly, create a variable called 'dtype' (this just follows the sytax of the example) which will define a list of tuples. There will be four tuples each representing the four different parts of the IP address. You can call these 'oct1', 'oct2' and so on (or something else that makes sense to you). All of these will have an integer type. Secondly, create a variable called 'values' (or again something else that makes sense to you) and assign IP_addresses which was the list of IP addresses as tuples that you created in the previous section to this variable. Thirdly, create your structured numpy array using the np.array method and pass the appropriate parameters as they do in the second example of the official docs. Finally, make sure you output your new NumPy array to the screen so you can see whether it has worked as expected."
