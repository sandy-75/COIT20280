Go ahead and construct a dictionary for all of the IP addresses that link the IP address with it's associated server eg. IP address 8.8.8.8 is linked with Google. See https://etherealmind.com/what-is-the-best-ip-address-to-ping-to-test-my-internet-connection/ for details of all IP addresses and which IP address is linked to which server. Note here that the ipaddress module - the IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library - the module that you should use if you need to do any practical work with IP addresses implements their IP addresses as hashable objects 'so that they can be used as keys in dictionaries' (see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html) similar to the way we use them here. For those who are interested see (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/ipaddress.html) for an introduction on the module."

From the documentation it may not be entirely clear what the default behaviour of sort() is when we have a list of lists. How is it really sorting our tuples? Is it only sorting on the first element of the nested tuple and then finishing or is it going through the first element, then the second element and so on? With our particular list of tuples in the format that they are, it is difficult to tell. Additionally, we know from the documentation that when there is a list of lists - they don't show any tuples here - they are stipulating on which key to sort - the first or second element and so on.

If sort() works on only the first element of the nested list then have a think about where it would appear in the sorted list. Remember that (as the documentation states) sort() is guaranteed to be stable which means the original ordering is guaranteed. This means that if it only sorted on the first element then another_IP_address will simply stay in last place. Apply the sort() now and see what happens."

It sorts on at least the first and third elements of our nested tuples. This isn't enough to guarantee that sort() works in exactly the way we think it does and will satisfy our criteria for sorting IP_addresses. However, we are on the right track and we would only need to do a couple more tests to be sure. Do this as an exercise now by testing to see if it works on the second and fourth elements of the IP address. You can do this in two steps or one step like we did above. Do that in the code cell below:"

Our code will be similar to the post on stackoverflow but certainly not the same. For someone reading code it is also likely that it is easier to understand what is going on - particularly for a newcomer or those who are a bit rusty on their coding. Depending on your experience level putting some of these steps into a dedicated function is overkill which is hard to disagree with. However, as an exercise hopefully we've got the hang of functions and how they improve organisation and re-use. This is the point of functions and this section. "

    "In this section we are going to follow along with a similar format to the Official NumPy documentation see: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html. We are also going to continue along using our familiar example of IP addresses that we used in the previous sections. Storing IP addresses as a NumPy array makes sense - the construct of many IP addresses together is essentially a construct of an nd-array - a multi-dimensional array of homogenous data. For those who are interested see Tom Augspurger's post (https://tomaugspurger.github.io/pandas-extension-arrays.html) for a practical scenario of using NumPy with IP addresses. Don't worry if the reading sounds a little advanced just note at this stage that NumPy is used to store IP addresses but that in order to cater for the complexity of a real-world situation a degree of coding 'trickery' had to be introduced."
