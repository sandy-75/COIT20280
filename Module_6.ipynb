    "Now it's time to see what the summary statistics reveal about each data column. Does there seem to be anything amiss here? Let's walk through it...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. count - here we have the same count for each of the Offense ID, Longitude and Latitude. Count gives us a count of all non-null values. We know from our csv file import that there are 3990 rows. Our count values here are 3990 also which indicates we have no missing or null values in these columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. mean - mean is the average of all the values in the columns. The 'Offense ID' column is simply a unique ID numeric value so the mean reported by describe doesn't tell us a lot here. This is a different story for Longitude and Latitude though. We see our mean values are 47.66 for Latitude and -122.28 for Longitude. We need to ask ourselves whether these are sensible values. Firstly, we can find out valid values for Latitude and Longitude by a simple web search (if we don't know already). Valid values for Latitude in degress are between -90 and +90 (Southern and Northern hemispheres respectively) and valid values for Longitude are between -180 and +180 (coordinates west and east of the Meridean). Our average values fall within this range so they are at least valid. In addition we can type these Latitude and Longitude values directly into Google search (type 47.66,-122.28 into the search bar) and we are provided with a map and our exact coordinates which puts us directly in Laurelhurst - right under the Seattle Children's Hospital. So not only are the average values of the Latitude and Longitude valid they also seem sensible given this crime reporting is for the area of Laurelhurst. We aren't getting results that put us in the middle of the Pacific Ocean which may make us question the quality of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. std - standard deviation is a measure of the variance of our data. For Offense ID this makes sense - we have a range of different values that are indeed quite large numbers so our std is itself quite large. Now what about Latitude and Longitude? We see that our Longitude varies by a small amount: 0.01. This seems small - which we would expect given that it is the crime reporting for a single residential neighbourhood - but not particularly accurate or precise. Our Latitude is given as 0.00 which seems very strange and indeed incorrect. We would expect our values to be small but we expect some variation in our Latitude. So is something wrong with our data or perhaps the precision with which our data is being displayed here? Well we know from our min and max reported by describe that we certainly don't have uniform data here. For std to accurately report 0 (zero) there could be no variation in our data at all. The problem is similar to the display issue we faced with 'Offense ID'. This time however, it is because we have a small number. In our initial display the default was 2 decimal places and when we changed the display to get rid of our e-notation it did nothing to change this. Let's change this now to get it to display to 10 decimal places with pd.options.display.float_format.\n",

    "4. min & max - The minimum and maximum values of the 'Offense ID' seem sensible. Note that without having more information on what is considered a valid range for this data the best we can do is rely on our knowledge of unique ID's (see for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_identifier). At this point we can see that the max and min are whole numbers ranging from 7625486301 to 25401859485 - perhaps serially generated. There is nothing terribly untoward about this and it seems to comply with our knowledge of what a unique ID might look like. Minimum values of Latitude and Longitude also seem sensible. We apply the same logic as we did in Step 2 above to arrive at this determination. Confirm this to yourself by putting the minimum and maximum values of Latitude and Longitude into google and you will get the two boundary points (extreme lower left - which places you right in the middle of Union Bay - and extreme upper right - on 55th Avenue NE just north of Windemere Park) of all your data points. Note that while we don't know the exact boundaries of the area that is being reported on we can do some work ourselves to see whether the data makes sense. We know that all of the data in the Longitude and Latitude columns are at least valid values. Additionally, in the context of the reporting it seems to make sense. All of the crimes that are reported here are contained within two extreme Latitude and Longitude points that cover the residential neighbourhood of Laurelhurst and do not seem to be in areas that extend beyond this.\n",

    "5. percentiles (25%, 50%, 75%) - our percentiles simply tell us how much of the data is less than this value. So for 25% and 'Offense ID' it is stating here that 25% of the data is less than 7651776285. Likewise for Longitude 25% of the data is less than the value -122.2853526600 and for Latitude 25% of the data is less than the value 47.6593671100. It is the same for the 50% and 75%. At this stage this information simply gives us a feel for our data. It is an analysis of sorts and in terms of data cleaning there is not a lot to make us suspicious of the quality of our data. There is a reasonable spread in terms of the numbers being reported here. Again, without being an expert in the particular area of the data itself and without more powerful visualisation tools we can't know for sure - but at this early stage the data at least seems to make sense.

    "1. count - remember that count gives us a count of all non-null values in each of the columns. Here we have the same count for 'Report Number', 'Report DateTime', 'Group A B', 'Crime Against Category', 'Offense Parent Group', 'Offense', 'Offense Code', 'Precinct', 'Sector', 'Beat', 'MCPP' and '100 Block Address' that we did for our numerical columns: 'Offense ID', 'Longitude' and 'Latitude'. That is, 3990. This tells us that there are no null values in these columns, which means there are no missing values we have to contend with. The same cannot be said for 'Offense Start DateTime' or 'Offense End DateTime'. Describe tells us here that there are null values in these columns that we will have to contend with. Given this information we should ask ourselves whether there is anything here which might make us suspicious of the underlying data quality. The only issue here is the 'Offense Start DateTime' and 'Offense End DateTime' but this fact doesn't seem terribly untoward. It would seem logical that not all reports would have an EndDate. Forexample - they might be still being investigated and in terms of the 'Start DateTime' this may simply be unknown. It would be something to double check if you had access to this information. At this stage we don't and we will have to be comfortable with this judgement call and make a note of it in our data cleaning report.   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. unique - this is a rather handy statistic for us both in terms of reporting categorical data and also numeric data (which the describe method doesn't do by default) in that it can give us an indication of duplicate data. Here we can see that for all of our non-numeric data we have repeats in the data. For example, let's look at Report Number. This has a unique value of 3817. However, we have 3990 rows. This means that there are some repeats in the values. The same goes for all of the other columns. This means that there is a potential for row duplication. If we had the Report Number giving a unique value of 3990 we would know that there is no row duplication and hence no duplication in our data. This is something to flag and investigate further on. What about the other data columns. What about Offense Start DateTime and Offense End DateTime? These not only have missing values as revealed by count but they also have repeats. Again, we don't know for sure whether this is suspicious or not without knowing more about the business context. One can think of numerous reasons why there may be Offenses that have the same start and end times. There may be peak times for crimes - crimes may genuinely occur at the same time and finish at the same time. When reporting crimes the accuracy and precision may be somewhat limited as well for whatever reason. At this stage, we could assume (and report this assumption) that these duplications are not untoward. The same goes for the Report DateTime. Group A B is a data category that works well with unique. If we had anything other than 2 here we might be suspicious of the quality of the data. While the metadata information provided by the Seattle Police Department doesn't give us a huge amount of detail we could assume that this category should only have either A or B. If there were anything greater than 2 reported here it would be worth noting and investigating further. All of the other categories here seem to make sense given the metadata information provided. Therefore, after looking at the statistics for unique all of the non-numeric columns here seem to make sense apart from the fact that we will have to check for duplicates later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. top & freq- together these two reported statistics tell us more about repeating values. It tells us the value that occurs the most and how many times it occurs. Here we can see that the Report Number 2018-162496 was the most repeated value occuring 5 times in our data. The other values that are reported here for the different columns provide us with some early analytical information. They are interesting at this stage but remember that our primary purpose now is to make sure we have quality data."

This was the Laurelhurst crime data set - an open data set provided by the Seattle Police Department. The next section will go into more detail on the cleaning methods available to us by continuing to follow through with this same example. This time however, the dataset has been changed to reflect a dirty dataset.  "

We will be using the methods as presented by McKinney (2017) for doing so. Additionally, this time we will be using the unclean version of the Laurelhurst_crime.csv dataset: Laurelhurst_crime_unclean.csv. This csv file is also available on Github (see: ) and has been intentionally modified from the clean version to give you experience with cleaning data. Of course this seems a little around the wrong way. In practice you would be given an unclean dataset - or at least a dataset that is in a state which is unknown and so is assumed to require some level of cleaning. You would then work toward getting a clean dataset. However, for the purposes of teaching and practice going the wrong way around - seeing a clean data set and then seeing a dirty data set - will serve us well enough.        "
