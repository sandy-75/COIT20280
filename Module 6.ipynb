    "This Jupyter Notebook contains all of the portfolio assessment related to Module 6. The assessment tasks start off with some simple data I/O tasks and gradually build up to more complicated data access tasks that deal with different formats and different platforms. The focus of these tasks is on building the skills that are required for accessing data - from very simple data I/O to more complex data access. Such skills are a critical but often overlooked part of data analysis. We will also be working with data from our case study 'Credit Card Fraud Detection' in this notebook. Cyber Analytics is the broader theme of the course so we try to ensure that you have as many opportunities as possible to work with that type of data. \n",

Following along with his tutorial may simply be a little too difficult for some however - the downloads are quite large and sniffing packets on your own system may not be practical for many due to permissions (you must be root). However, Eddings Jupyter Notebook on github (https://github.com/secdevopsai/Packet-Analytics/blob/master/Packet-Analytics.ipynb) and the official Scapy docs (https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) provide enough information for you to explore and understand data in a pcap file. To make things a little easier we have provided you with a pcap file to use EK_MALWARE_2014-08-01-Nuclear-EK-traffic_mailware-traffic-analysis.net.pcap. You can get this file from GitHub here (https://github.com/sandy-75/COIT20280).
